# 👤 User Service

The **User Service** is a core microservice responsible for managing **user profile data** and **monthly budget information**.  
It maintains user-related state required by the application and stays synchronized with the authentication system through **event-driven communication**.

This service **consumes user-related events** published by the Auth Service via **Apache Kafka**, ensuring loose coupling and avoiding direct dependencies between services.
